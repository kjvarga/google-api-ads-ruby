# Google Ads Savon

## Customized version

This is a stock v1.0.2 clone with the gemspec's Builder requirement relaxed from ~3.2 to >=3.0.
Without this, bunder fails on change_production because it cannot find compatible versions of Builder due to
conflicting requirements.

***

Google Ads Savon is a fork of [Savon 1](http://savonrb.com/version1/)
specific for use with the Google Ads Ruby Client Library.

Google Ads Savon is available through [Rubygems](http://rubygems.org/gems/google-ads-savon) and can be installed via:

    $ gem install google-ads-savon

This library is not intended for re-use outside of google-ads-common.

This is not an official Google product (experimental or otherwise), it is just code that happens to be owned by Google.
